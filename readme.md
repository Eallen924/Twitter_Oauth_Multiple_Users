##Twitter Oauth Example

This is a simple Sinatra application that allows a user to login via Twitter Oauth and tweet on their behalf. The only code not written by me is the /config files. 


###To use run:

* ```bundle install```
* ```rake db:create```, will create your database.
* ```rake db:migrate```, will migrate your database.
* ```shotgun```, will start the Sinatra server... and you're good to go!
