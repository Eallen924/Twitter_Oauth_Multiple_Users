##Twitter Oauth Example

This is a simple Sinatra application that allows a user to login via Twitter Oauth and tweet on their behalf. The /config files and the rake file were not enitirely written by me. The basic setup of these files was provided by Dev Bootcamp.  


###To use run:

* ```bundle install```
* ```rake db:create```, will create your database.
* ```rake db:migrate```, will migrate your database.
* ```shotgun```, will start the Sinatra server... and you're good to go!
